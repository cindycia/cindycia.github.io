Consider, for example, an autonomous robot vehicle driving in dense, unregulated urban traffic of cars, motorcycles, buses, etc.. The robot vehicle has to plan in both short and long terms, in order to interact with many traffic participants of uncertain intentions and drive effectively. Planning explicitly over a long time horizon, however, incurs prohibitive computational cost and is impractical under real-time constraints. To achieve real-time performance for large-scale planning, this work introduces a new algorithm Learning from Tree Search for Driving (LeTS-Drive), which integrates planning and learning in a closed loop, and applies it to autonomous driving in crowded urban traffic in simulation. Specifically, LeTS-Drive learns a policy and its value function from data provided by an online planner, which searches a sparsely-sampled belief tree; the online planner in turn uses the learned policy and value functions as heuristics to scale up its run-time performance for real-time robot control. These two steps are repeated to form a closed loop so that the planner and the learner inform each other and improve in synchrony. The algorithm learns on its own in a self-supervised manner, without human effort on explicit data labeling. Experimental results demonstrate that LeTS-Drive outperforms either planning or learning alone, as well as open-loop integration of planning and learning.","tags":null,"title":"Closing the Planning-Learning Loop with Application to Autonomous Driving","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Cai Panpan"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1653267600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1653267600,"objectID":"f9e789293a9c468101c5ada659f99078","permalink":"/talk/icra-2022-gamma/","publishdate":"2022-05-27T14:11:54+08:00","relpermalink":"/talk/icra-2022-gamma/","section":"talk","summary":"A spotlight talk given at ICRA 2022 for the paper \"GAMMA.

GAMMA models heterogeneous, interactive traffic agents that operate under diverse road conditions, with various geometric and kinematic constraints. GAMMA treats the prediction task as constrained optimization in traffic agents’ velocity space. The objective is to optimize an agent’s driving performance, while obeying all the constraints resulting from the agent’s kinematics, collision avoidance with other agents, and the environmental context. Further, GAMMA explicitly conditions the prediction on human behavioral states as parameters of the optimization model, in order to account for versatile human behaviors. We evaluated GAMMA on a set of real-world benchmark datasets. The results show that GAMMA achieves high prediction accuracy on both homogeneous and heterogeneous traffic datasets, with sub-millisecond execution time. Further, the computational efficiency and the flexibility of GAMMA enable (i) simulation of mixed urban traffic at many locations worldwide and (ii) planning for autonomous driving in dense traffic with uncertain driver behaviors, both in real-time.

Many tasks also require reasoning about long-term consequences of robot decisions. The partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) offers a principled approach for planning under uncertainty. However, its computational complexity grows exponentially with the planning horizon. We propose to use temporally-extended macro-actions to cut down the effective planning horizon and thus the exponential factor of the complexity. We propose Macro-Action Generator-Critic (MAGIC), an algorithm that learns a macro-action generator using feedback from a planner, and in turn uses the learned macro-actions to condition long-horizon planning. Importantly, the generator is learned to directly maximize the down-stream planning performance. We evaluate MAGIC on several long-term planning tasks, showing that it significantly outperforms planning using primitive actions and hand-crafted macro-actions in both simulation and on a real robot.","tags":null,"title":"MAGIC: Learning Macro-Actions for Online POMDP Planning using Generator-Critic","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Panpan Cai","Yiyuan Lee","Yuanfu Luo","David Hsu"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1598918400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1598918400,"objectID":"3e8bc09da4f00693c0e45e43858829b4","permalink":"/publication/cai-2019-summit/","publishdate":"2020-11-07T11:46:20.943118Z","relpermalink":"/publication/cai-2019-summit/","section":"publication","summary":"Autonomous driving in an unregulated urban crowd is an outstanding challenge, especially, in the presence of many aggressive, high-speed traffic participants.

To handle a large crowd and achieve realtime performance in this very challenging setting, we propose LeTS-Drive, which integrates online POMDP planning and deep learning. It consists of two phases. In the offline phase, we learn a policy and the corresponding value function by imitating the belief tree search.

This paper considers the lifting path planning problem for terrain cranes in complex environments. The lifting path planning problem takes inputs such as the plant environment, crane mechanical data, crane position, start and end lifting configurations to generate the optimal lifting path by evaluating costs and safety risks. We formulate the crane lifting path planning as a multi-objective nonlinear integer optimization problem with implicit constraints. It aims to optimize the energy cost, time cost and human operation conformity of the lifting path under constraints of collision avoidance and operational limitations. To solve the optimization problem, we design a Master–Slave Parallel Genetic Algorithm and implement the algorithm on Graphics Processing Units using CUDA programming.
