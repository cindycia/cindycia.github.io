Many tasks also require reasoning about long-term consequences of robot decisions. The partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) offers a principled approach for planning under uncertainty. However, its computational complexity grows exponentially with the planning horizon. We propose to use temporally-extended macro-actions to cut down the effective planning horizon and thus the exponential factor of the complexity. We propose Macro-Action Generator-Critic (MAGIC), an algorithm that learns a macro-action generator using feedback from a planner, and in turn uses the learned macro-actions to condition long-horizon planning. Importantly, the generator is learned to directly maximize the down-stream planning performance. We evaluate MAGIC on several long-term planning tasks, showing that it significantly outperforms planning using primitive actions and hand-crafted macro-actions in both simulation and on a real robot.","tags":null,"title":"MAGIC: Learning Macro-Actions for Online POMDP Planning using Generator-Critic","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Panpan Cai","Yiyuan Lee","Yuanfu Luo","David Hsu"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1598918400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1598918400,"objectID":"3e8bc09da4f00693c0e45e43858829b4","permalink":"/publication/cai-2019-summit/","publishdate":"2019-11-07T11:46:20.943118Z","relpermalink":"/publication/cai-2019-summit/","section":"publication","summary":"Autonomous driving in an unregulated urban crowd is an outstanding challenge, especially, in the presence of many aggressive, high-speed traffic participants.

The robot vehicle must contend with a dynamic and partially observable environment, noisy sensors, and many agents. A principled approach is to formalize it as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) and solve it through online belief-tree search. To handle a large crowd and achieve realtime performance in this very challenging setting, we propose LeTS-Drive, which integrates online POMDP planning and deep learning. It consists of two phases. In the offline phase, we learn a policy and the corresponding value function by imitating the belief tree search. In the online phase, the learned policy and value function guide the belief tree search. LeTS-Drive leverages the robustness of planning and the runtime efficiency of learning to enhance the performance of both. Experimental results in simulation show that LeTS-Drive outperforms either planning or imitation learning alone and develops sophisticated driving skills.","tags":null,"title":"LeTS-Drive: Driving in a Crowd by Learning from Tree Search","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Malika Meghjani","Yuanfu Luo","Qi Heng Ho","Panpan Cai","Shashwat Verma","Daniela Rus","David Hsu"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1554091200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1554091200,"objectID":"9255e6fa23a10a8b0fc7c3e6b35a533f","permalink":"/publication/iros-2019-driving/","publishdate":"2019-11-08T19:03:21+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/iros-2019-driving/","section":"publication","summary":"We present a novel autonomous driving system which uses the road contextual information and intentions of other road users for urban driving.

State-of-the-art online search algorithms, such as DESPOT, have vastly improved the computational efficiency of planning under uncertainty and made it a valuable tool for robotics in practice. This work takes one step further by leveraging both CPU and GPU parallelization in order to achieve near real-time online planning performance for complex tasks with large state, action, and observation spaces. Specifically, we propose Hybrid Parallel DESPOT (HyPDESPOT), a massively parallel online planning algorithm that integrates CPU and GPU parallelism in a multi-level scheme. It performs parallel DESPOT tree search by simultaneously traversing multiple independent paths using multi-core CPUs and performs parallel Monte-Carlo simulations at the leaf nodes of the search tree using GPUs.

It is conducted frequently during the time of plant construction, maintenance shutdown and new equipment installation. To find a safe and cost effective way of lifting, a team works for weeks or even months doing site investigation, planning and evaluations. This paper considers the lifting path planning problem for terrain cranes in complex environments. The lifting path planning problem takes inputs such as the plant environment, crane mechanical data, crane position, start and end lifting configurations to generate the optimal lifting path by evaluating costs and safety risks. We formulate the crane lifting path planning as a multi-objective nonlinear integer optimization problem with implicit constraints. It aims to optimize the energy cost, time cost and human operation conformity of the lifting path under constraints of collision avoidance and operational limitations. To solve the optimization problem, we design a Master–Slave Parallel Genetic Algorithm and implement the algorithm on Graphics Processing Units using CUDA programming.
